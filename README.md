## 🌈 About

**NOMA turns rent — the biggest expense of a generation — into yield and on-chain reputation.**

Across LATAM, Asia, and the U.S., most young people don’t buy homes — they rent.  
They work in the gig economy, get paid irregularly, and lack formal financial histories.

Rent today is:
- Dead money  
- Invisible to financial systems  
- The largest monthly cashflow that builds nothing  

**NOMA makes rent productive.**

Tenants earn yield by paying rent early or on time.  
Landlords receive guaranteed, programmable cashflow.

Behind the scenes:
- Rent payments are routed into DeFi yield strategies  
- AI agents optimize allocation and timing  
- Each payment builds an on-chain rent reputation  

Rent becomes:
- 💰 Yield  
- 🤝 Trust  
- 🔓 Financial access
